# TestingERC721_A
Test Scripts for Custom ERC721: This is an ongoing project for storing testing scripts for custom contracts. 

The first contract is a slightly custom ERC721 called 'TestMedallionAnyAddressMintA.sol'. The goal of this repo is not necessarily to create a truly comprehensive list of tests for a 721 or ERC20, but is instead focused on testing everything/anything that touches the customized portion of the ERC721. In other words, I am trusting OpenZeppelin's audit of the basic ERC721 functionality and safety created from the OZ Wizard.

Over time I will be adding more testing scripts to this repo so that this can eventually become a library of test scripts for custom Solidity contracts.
